## 🖥️ The Concept
This project is an exploration of **Complex State Management** and **Component Architecture** in React. Instead of a traditional scroll-down website, I built a functional operating system in the browser.

It features a working Desktop environment, Window management system, and native-feeling applications that showcase my projects and skills.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Window Management:** Full drag-and-drop functionality, minimizing, and maximizing windows (simulating an OS window manager).
* **The Dock:** Interactive dock with magnification effects using Framer Motion.
* **Functional Apps:**
    * **Terminal:** A working CLI to navigate the portfolio via commands.
    * **VS Code:** A lightweight code editor viewer to showcase code snippets.
    * **Safari:** An iframe browser to preview my other web projects.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts fluidly from Desktop to Mobile layouts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / SCSS
* **Animations:** Framer Motion
* **Icons:** React Icons / FontAwesome
* **Deployment:** Vercel
